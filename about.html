      <p><strong>ANTI-PC</strong> is a philosophy disguised as hardware. It is not a product. It is an engineered declaration of independence from corporate design dogma.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fanless. Passive cooling only.</li>
        <li>No RGB. No brand stickers. No nonsense.</li>
        <li>Fully modular. Every part can be replaced or upgraded by hand.</li>
        <li>Built with real components. Not a concept. Not a dream.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is <em>Version 0.1</em>. Future versions may emerge. Or not. That's up to the network.</p>
